# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a snake that grows longer as it consumes randomly placed food on the screen. The player controls the snake's movement to avoid collisions with the game boundaries and itself.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `snake_game.py` script.

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

2. Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's movement.

3. Try to eat the randomly appearing food to increase your snake's length.

4. The game ends if the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself.

5. If you lose, you can press 'C' to play again or 'Q' to quit.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game by tweaking variables, such as colors, display dimensions, or game speed, directly in the `snake_game.py` script. You can also modify the game aesthetics, fonts, and other elements according to your preferences.
